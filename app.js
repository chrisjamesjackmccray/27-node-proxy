     *    Setup an if statement to check if they're looking at /
     *
     *    If they are, use req.write() to send them a message
     *    explaining that they're on the root page.
     *
     * 2. If they're looking at /other then use req.write() to
     *    send a message explaining that they're on the other page.
     *
     * 3. Remember to use req.end() after you're done using req.write()
     *    so that you actually send a response to the browser.
     *
     * 4. You should be able to run npm run app and visit localhost:8000
     *    in your browser. At /, you should see the / message. At /other,
     *    you should see the other message.
